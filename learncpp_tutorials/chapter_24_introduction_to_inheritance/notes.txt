24.2 Basic inheritance in C++
- Inheritance in C++ takes places between classes. In an inheritance (is a ) relationship. 

24.3 Constructors and initializaton of derived classes
- when base is instantiated
  Memory for base is set aside
  The appropriate Base constructor is called
  The member initializer list initializes variables
  The body of the constructor executes
  Control is returned to the caller
- The end result is that the above example does not work because m_id was inherited from Base,
  and only non-inherited variables can be initialized in the member initializer list.
- Note that it doesnâ€™t matter where in the Derived constructor member initializer list the Base constructor is called -- it will always execute first.

24.5 Inheritance and access specifiers
- Favor private members over protected members.
