10.1 Implict type conversion
- the process of producing a new value of some type from a value of different type is called a conversion
- Type conversions can be invoked in one of two ways: either implicit or explicit.
- brace-initialization disallows conversions that result in data loss

10.2 Floating point and integral promotion
- The number of bits a data type uses is called its width. A wider data type is one that uses more bits, and a narrower data type is one that uses less bits.
- Numeric promotions is the type conversion of certain narrower numeric types (such as char) to certain wider numeric types that can be processed efficiently
- All numeric promotions are value preserving. A value preserving conversion is one where every possbile source value can be 
  converted into and equal value of the destination type
- The numeric promotions rules are divided into two subcategories. integral promotions and floating point promotions. 
  Only the conversions listed in these categories are considered to be numeric promotions

10.3 Numeric conversions
- Any type conversion covered by the numeric promotion is called a numeric promotion, not a numeric conversion
- There are 5 basics types of numeric conversions
    1) converting an integral type to any other integral type
    2) Converting a floating point type to any other floating point type
    3) converting a floating point type to any integral type
    4) converting a integral type to any floating point type
    5) Converting an integral type or a floating point type to a bool
